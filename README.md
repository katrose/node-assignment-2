# Node Assignment #2 - Express Website with Contact Form

For this assignment, I used my final project/portfolio from CPNT 262.

## Notes:

### Forms
- There are two different forms on the site: a contact form (from the original assignment in CPNT 262) and a newsletter form in the footer. The same POST function handles these two forms and writes all the data to one log file, but normally you would want to log these separately. 

- Footer form isn't responsive

### File Logger
For this to work, the directory where logs are stored (logs/) must already exist to create a new log file.
